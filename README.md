# Number Trivia

## Description

The **Number Trivia** project is a web application that allows users to discover interesting facts about numbers. By entering a number or requesting a random fact, users can explore trivia related to that number, fetched from the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).

This project is a great way to practice using public APIs, specifically focusing on asynchronous data fetching with JavaScript (`fetch`), input validation, and dynamic rendering of content.

## Features

- **Number-based Trivia**: Enter a number to get trivia related to it.
- **Random Number Trivia**: Get a random trivia fact by clicking the "Get Random Fact" button.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input is within a valid range (0 to 300).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to look good on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout (including animations).
- **JavaScript**: Fetching data from the Numbers API and handling the logic.
- **API**: [Numbers API](https://rapidapi.com/)

## Conclusion

In this project, I learned how to interact with a public API (Numbers API) and display dynamic content on the web page. I also gained experience in handling user input, managing edge cases, and making my application user-friendly with responsive design and animations.
